OS Config
============
This contains my bash configurations and customization's so when
I upgrade I can quickly get everything up and going again.

Most of everything else that used to be here has been moved to
other repositories. For example VIM, and Emacs now have their
own config files.

Setup
==============
After running the setup script your .bashrc should have
the bash_settings.sh appended to the end of the script.
Any customization's should be placed in bash_settings.sh
so the changes can be preserved after OS upgrades.
